    "## 🎯 Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Understand** the biological principle of lateral inhibition and its role in sensory processing\n",
    "2. **Implement** a spiking neural network (SNN) with lateral inhibition using `snntorch`\n",
    "3. **Observe** edge enhancement and the Mach band illusion in neural responses\n",
    "4. **Connect** biological lateral inhibition to convolutional neural networks (CNNs)\n",
    "5. **Explain** the efficient coding hypothesis and how lateral inhibition compresses sensory information\n",
    "6. **Explore** Hopfield networks as an advanced application of recurrent connections\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📚 Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "**Knowledge:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Basic Python programming and PyTorch\n",
    "- Understanding of neurons and spiking (see Tutorial 13: STDP Learning)\n",
    "- Familiarity with NumPy and basic plotting\n",
    "\n",
    "**Installation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial requires the `snntorch` library. Make sure to install it by running:\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Lateral inhibition is a fundamental principle in neurobiology where an excited neuron reduces the activity of its neighbors. This mechanism increases the contrast and sharpness of sensory responses, enabling the brain to detect edges and boundaries effectively. In the visual system, this is famously observed in retinal ganglion cells and the Mach band illusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will build a simple network of LIF neurons to model this phenomenon.\n"

    "## 1. Theory: Lateral Inhibition\n",
    "\n",
    "Lateral inhibition is the capacity of an excited neuron to reduce the activity of its neighbors. Lateral inhibition disables the spreading of action potentials from excited neurons to neighboring neurons in the lateral direction. This creates a contrast in stimulation that allows increased sensory perception.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, we can model the input current $I_i$ to neuron $i$ as:\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- prettier-ignore -->\n",
    "$$ I_i = X_i - \\sum_{j \\neq i} w_{ij} Y_j $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $X_i$ is the excitatory input from the receptor (or previous layer).\n",
    "- $Y_j$ is the output (spike) of neighbor neuron $j$.\n",
    "- $w_{ij}$ is the inhibitory weight from neuron $j$ to neuron $i$.\n",

    "3.  **Long-range silence**: Neurons far away do not interact.\n",
