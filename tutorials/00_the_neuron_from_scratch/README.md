> This series of notebooks (neurons from scratch) was built for the [Computational Neuroscience Imbizo](https://imbizo.africa) and may be a useful resource for anyone looking to get familiar with some neuroscience, math-to-code, and Python software engineering. It is designed to be hands-on and interactive, with lots of code examples and exercises. Enjoy!
