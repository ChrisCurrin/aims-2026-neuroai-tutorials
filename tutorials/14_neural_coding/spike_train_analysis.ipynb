    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Generate synthetic spike trains using Poisson processes.\n",
    "- Visualize neural activity using raster plots.\n",
    "- Calculate basic statistics like firing rates and Inter-Spike Intervals (ISIs).\n",
    "- Compute variability measures such as the Coefficient of Variation (CV) and Fano Factor.\n",
    "- Apply Information Theory concepts like Entropy and Mutual Information to neural data.\n",
    "- Implement a population decoder to classify stimuli based on neural activity.\n",
    "- Use standard Machine Learning libraries (`scikit-learn`) for neural decoding.\n",
    "- Understand the difference between single-neuron and population coding.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📚 Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "- Basic Python programming (lists, loops, functions).\n",
    "- Familiarity with `numpy` arrays.\n",
    "- Basic understanding of probability (distributions, means).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Neurons communicate using discrete electrical pulses called **action potentials** or **spikes**. A sequence of spikes over time is called a **spike train**. Because the exact timing of spikes can be irregular, we often treat them as stochastic processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will explore how to analyze these spike trains. We will start by generating synthetic data, then move on to visualizing it, calculating statistics, and finally, using the activity of a population of neurons to \"decode\" what stimulus the brain is seeing.\n",

    "1.  Start with 1 active neuron.\n",
