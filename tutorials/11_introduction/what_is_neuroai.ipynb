    "**NeuroAI** sits at the intersection of two of the most exciting fields of our time: neuroscience and artificial intelligence. But it's more than just combining two disciplines - it's a recognition that understanding intelligence requires insights from both.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Core Insight\n",
    "\n",
    "The brain is the only system we know of that exhibits general intelligence. Meanwhile, artificial neural networks - loosely inspired by the brain - have achieved remarkable feats in narrow domains. NeuroAI asks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What can AI teach us about the brain?** Neural networks provide testable computational theories of brain function.\n",
    "- **What can the brain teach us about AI?** Evolution has solved problems that AI still struggles with (efficiency, generalization, continual learning).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is not a new idea. The history of AI is deeply intertwined with neuroscience - from the perceptron (1958) inspired by neurons, to convolutional networks inspired by the visual cortex, to attention mechanisms that echo theories of selective attention in cognition.\n"
